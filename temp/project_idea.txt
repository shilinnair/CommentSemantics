Approach 1
===============

- search the feature location using comments vs code.
- verify it usin gold set
- Analyse are we getting accurate results with comments or with code
- if code is givign more accurate result that shows project is lacking good comments
- comments needs to be improved.
- if the comment is giving more accurate result, it has a proper semantically accurate commenting in place.

 
* Assesing comment quality of Softare Systems using Latent Semantic Indexing ( An NLP based Feature  Location Technique)

* An approach to evaluate comment semantics using feature location, NLP 
* Assessing comment semantics by applying NLP based Feature location technique)
 
 
 Textual feature location techniques
 Latent Semantic Indexing, Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF are the two techniques

Mention about the parser in the document. Java parser, comment parsing docuent creation etc.


may be  VSM technique along with LSI if time permits.

Various phases of the research implementation.

phase 1 : parsing and document creation
phsae2 : processing, applying FL technique LSI and VSM
Phase3 : Evaluation phase how comments are able to locate the feature.

how semantically close to the source code.

goal : NLP analysis to detect non english comments and eliminate from parsing.

what is the result if include commented code and what is the reslt if exclude commented code. - this is a novality in the research


These are the research questiosn i m going to address in the research if project timeline, semster time external factor matches I would be able to comeplet this.

Prof comments:
Phases pf the project:

Parse the project and creating document using their comment and artifact names.
Applying Feature location i.e., LSI maybe VSM if time permits.
Evaluation. It will take the output of the previous phase and compare it against the goldset.
 

Some comments are code-commented, it would be good to identify them using some NLP techniques and exclude them from your FL analysis.

Q: Is it improving the quality of the FL by removing code-commented?
