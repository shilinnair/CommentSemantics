 * IM message listener. This listener receives {@link IIMMessageEvent}s.

 * free to call the methods below with an arbitrary thread, so the
 * implementation of these methods must be appropriately prepared.
 * <p>
 * </p>
 * For example, if the code implementing any of these methods must interact with
 * user interface code, then it should use code such as the following to execute

 * 
 * <pre>
 * 	Display.getDefault().asyncExec(new Runnable() {
 * 		public void run() {
 * 		... UI code here
 * 		}
 * 	});
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Further, the code in the implementations of these methods should <b>not block</b> via 
 * I/O operations or blocking UI calls.
